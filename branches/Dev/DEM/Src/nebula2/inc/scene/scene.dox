    @defgroup Scene Scene System

    This page describes the scene system and general rendering process of Nebula.
    
    A Nebula2 @b scene is a collection of <b>scene node hierarchies</b>, each
    of which normally represents a visible object in the 3-D world.
    
    @ref SceneNodes is the root class of all objects that can be 
    grouped into such hierarchies.  Read @ref NebulaSceneNodesSceneNodes,
    @ref NebulaSceneNodesVisualNodes, and @ref NebulaSceneNodesHierarchies now.

    @ref SceneServers set up and optimize the scene before passing
    it off to the lower-level graphics API (@ref NebulaGraphicsSystem).

    If your application is complicated or large, you will probably need to write
    you own custom scene server.  This document should help you understand
    enough to do so.

    @section SceneRenderingLoop

    The rendering loop of Nebula looks roughly like this:

       -# nSceneServer::BeginScene
       -# nSceneServer::Attach is invoked on each visual hierarchy root
          object that wants to be rendered.
       -# nSceneServer::EndScene
       -# nSceneServer::RenderScene
       -# nSceneServer::PresentScene

    Step (1) prepares rendering. It contains initializing per frame variables
    and loading resources if necessary.

    Step (2) determines which visual objects are part of ("attached to") the 
    scene this frame and what parameters they are using.  The @e application 
    accomplishes this by passing the @ref SceneRenderContext of every 
    (potentially) visible object to nSceneServer::Attach.

    A render context contains a pointer to the root of a scene node
    hierarchy, plus a transform matrix, frame id, shader parameters, 
    user-defined variables, etc. The additional information is necessary because
    several game objects may share the same scene node hierarchy (see 
    @ref NebulaSceneNodesAttachMultipleTimes).

    @note 
    The scene is completely recreated every frame!  That is, any object that 
    wishes to be continously visible must be reattached in each render
    loop iteration.

    Step (3) performs any cleanup needed before continuing.

    Step (4) organizes the scene into an optimal form and then renders it to
    the back buffer.  What exactly happens here is entirely up the particular
    nSceneServer subclass being used, but nStdSceneServer illustrates the
    basic procedure:

       - <b>Validate resources</b>
         : ensure that all attached nodes have loaded their resources.

       - <b>Split and Sort pass</b>
         : separate nodes into light and geometry (shape) nodes, then
           sorted them by shader (to minimize shader switches).

       - <b>Render pass</b> consists of the following stages, each called
         separately for each node:
         - <b>Shader pass</b>
           : specify the shader and (render context-based) shader parameters
           (usually with nMaterialNode::RenderShader).
         - <b>Light pass</b>
           : calculate light data to be passed to the shader.
         - <b>Geometry pass</b>
           : update mesh geometry, usually with nShapeNode::RenderGeometry.

    Step (5) finalizes rendering and presents the scene to the user.

    @note
    nGfxServer2::PresentScene() should be invoked after EndScene().

    That is the basics of Nebula scene system.
